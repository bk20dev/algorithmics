# Algorithmics

This repository contains solutions to common (and some unusual) algorithmics problems.

## 🐙 `ships.cpp`

All of us have propably ever played a game of ships. This program finds sizes of all ships on a board.

### How to use

1. Create a file named `ships.txt`
2. Fill the file with a square of size 8x8 filled with `0` (water) and `1` (ship).

> 💡 **Tip:** If you are not sure how the file should look like, feel free to take a look at the example in `./samples/` directory.

3. Compile the program

```bash
g++ ships.cpp -o ships.out
```

4. Run the program and watch the console window

```bash
./ships.out
```

## 🪁 `lzw.cpp`

Compresses a file using [Lempel-Ziv-Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch) technique

### How to use

1. Create a file named `input.txt`
2. Fill the file with some text (eg. [lorem ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/))
3. Compile the program

```bash
g++ lzw.cpp -o lzw.out
```

4. Run the program

```bash
./lzw.out
```

5. Open the newly created `compressed.txt`

## 🌀 `spiral.cpp`

Fills spirally a square array with consecutive numbers in the choosen direction.

### How to use

1. Compile the program

```bash
g++ spiral.cpp -o spiral.out
```

2. Run the program

```bash
./spiral.out
```

3. Input a direction
   - `0` for counter-clockwise
   - `1` for clockwise
4. Type in a size
5. Watch the console window
